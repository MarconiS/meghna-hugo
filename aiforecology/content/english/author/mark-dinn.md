My curiosity covers different aspects of global change ecology and resource management. The common divisor is the use of modeling techniques to explore and predict ecological processes. I'm mainly engrossed in biogeochemical and vegetation modeling, from individual to regional scale. I'm interested in climate related alterations on tree auto-ecology and phenology; in LULUCF and pathogens related disturbances on landscape to regional scale. How will these trade-offs impact landscape patterns?
